Telehealth Solution for Access to Healthcare from Anywhere
Problem Statement
Post pandemic, the world has changed significantly. Quick access to quality, affordable, and reliable healthcare from anywhere is the need of the hour. People are confined in remote locations in their homes, and hence there is an urgent need to come up with a digitally enabled solution to address the following:

1)Instant Access to Health Consultation: Provide an experience similar to in-person consultations by developing a Telehealth application.
2)Patient Information Capture: Collect basic patient information and the specific specialty for which Telehealth consultation is needed.
3)Payment Processing: Accept payments for the Telehealth consultation before the actual consultation begins.
4)Privacy and Security: Ensure no compromise in the privacy of the consultation involving PHI data and the ability to securely save the information for future reference.
5)In-App Chat and Information Sharing: Enable chat and information sharing from within the application during the Telehealth session.
6)Transcription Service: Overcome challenges of difference in dialect/accent in remote consultation via a transcription service.
